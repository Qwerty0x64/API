I know that through effort and patience, this project will soon grow into an extremely inspirational and popular extension/application, that will allow people of all ages to enjoy the experience of using this extension/application."},{"id":"qualities","question":"What qualities would you bring to the team?","required":true,"label":"What qualities would you bring to the team?","response":"I bring high-qualities to the team to ensure customers get the best experience when requesting support. I believe all people should be treated equally, which is one quality, respect. I can give to you that others can not, is a heart. I not only set my limits high, but I also break those limits and exceed my expectations for the group and the staff. I help keep the staff healthy and happy. The group? Anyone can donate, anyone can work hard, anyone can serve people well. But characteristic traits of kindness and respect, are just from the heart. Not just anyone has that. I exceed my expectations mainly for the people of the group. Not for the group. Because without these people there would be no group. So I can't not pay them back. I'd like to thank those who make a group. Without these people, the word \"group\" would not have the correct meaning. I go far for these people. I save lives because time is short. Time is precious. These people sacrifice time for OUR group and harmony, together! So, thank you, all."},{"id":"applicants","question":"Why should we choose you over other applicants?","required":true,"label":"Why should we choose you over other applicants?","response":"You should hire me over others because I look past all of the whole big picture, and focus in on the little details. Sounds bad at first right? Wrong. You forgot, a camera has several points of view. I CAN look at the big picture, but dividing it and taking baby steps can be much better than rushing to do everything. This means, I focus on the Discord, the staff, the applications, the forms, the recruiting, rather than just running everything. I develop, and prepare. We want good, dedicated, workers. We want everything ready and prepared. I don't like to let things slide when they aren't fully corrected or done. It just isn't right. Patience is a very good thing to have, and It's honestly needed."},{"id":"optional","question":"Anything else we should know?","required":false,"label":"Anything else we should know?
